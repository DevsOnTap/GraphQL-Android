This is a sample Android project that demonstrates the benefits of using RxJava Observables with Retrofit, rather than their default Call object.

The MainActivity demonstrates 3 different ways to make the Retrofit call:

1. RxJava Observable
2. AsyncTask + synchronous Call request
3. Async Call request with Callback object

### Usage

'gradle installDebug'
